In this short blog post, I will be showing you some keyboard shortcuts and tips for VS Code that I use every time I code.

### Move line up or down
If you were like me before and you wanted to move a line or block of code, you used to cut and paste that code around. Now you can simply move your code up or down  with Alt + Up ou Down. If you want to move a line, you don't even need to highlight it.

### Select current line
If you want to select the current line your cursor is on, press Ctrl + I

### Cut/ copy a line without highlighting
Instead of highlighting the line you want to cut/copy, just put your cursor anywhere on the line and press Ctrl + X/C to copy or cut the entire line.

### Duplicate line
Press shift+alt+down or shift+alt+up to duplicate the line where you cursor is, you don't even need to highlight the whole line

### Multiple cursors

To add secondary cursors you press Alt + Click or if you want to add secondary cursors above and below, you can use Ctrl + Alt + Up or Ctrl + Alt + Down.

Ctrl + D lets you select the current word where your cursor is and press it again to select the next occurence.

If you want to select every occurrences of the word, use Ctrl + Shift + L

### Rename symbol
If you made a typo in a variable or function and you don't want to rename it everywhere one by one or do a find and replace, use Ctrl + F2 to rename all occurrences in the current file

### Go to Symbol in File
<kbd>Ctrl + Shift + O</kbd> to see all the symbols in your file with an autocomplete to rapidly go to your desire symbol. You can type : to group symbol together (variables, interface, functions)
